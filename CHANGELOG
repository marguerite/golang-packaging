== update version 14.8.1 ==

  * bugfix release

== update version 14.8 ==

  * rpmsysinfo.rb: fix encoding problem in open()
  * cli.rb: ruby 1.8.7 doesn't support passing environment variables in open(),
    some commands/tests need time to finish, an immediate io.close() will get us
    wrong exitstatus (broken pipe, code 13). so use 'timeout' module with a 30s
    and process.wait for them to quit successfully
  * golang.req: the oniguruma in ruby 1.8.7 doesn't support named group in
    regexp. so ditch the named group used in go_get_version()

  * if importpath has "test/example", it should survive (github#5)
  * merge macros.go from openSUSE's go here
  * add golang-macros.rb, replacement for the complicated macros in shell in
    macros.go
  * golang-macros.rb:
    + support build with fake build id
    + support build with custom tags (github#7)
    + support pass any -<arg>="a b c" or -<arg>=<value> to go install, shared
      build is possible now (not fully support, other macros need to be adapted)
    + --filelist, to generate filelist used in %files section with excluding
      support
    + use IO.popen to break the build at the exact place
      it fails (github#6)
