== update version 15.0.0 ==

  * Total refactoring of the codebase, dropped the ruby dependency and now we
    are also using pure bash and go tooling

== update version 14.9.2 ==

  * Added go_nostrip macro to disable stripping of debug information and to
    disable a debug package

== update version 14.9.1 ==

  * simplify rpmsysinfo.rb: don't guess variables' values can be passed in by
    RPM environment variables. use RbConfig to get libdir.

== update version 14.9.0 ==

  * Remove runtime dependency for Go API

== update version 14.8.1 ==

  * bugfix release
  * fix a typo in cli.rb
  * increase timeout to 300s, or go install can't finish itself sometimes

== update version 14.8 ==

  * rpmsysinfo.rb: fix encoding problem in open()
  * cli.rb: ruby 1.8.7 doesn't support passing environment variables in open(),
    some commands/tests need time to finish, an immediate io.close() will get us
    wrong exitstatus (broken pipe, code 13). so use 'timeout' module with a 30s
    and process.wait for them to quit successfully
  * golang.req: the oniguruma in ruby 1.8.7 doesn't support named group in
    regexp. so ditch the named group used in go_get_version()

== update version 14.7 ==

  * do not hardcode go version

== update version 14.6 ==

  * fix rbarch for Power Archtectures

== update version 14.5 ==

== update version 14 ==

  * if importpath has "test/example", it should survive (github#5)
  * merge macros.go from openSUSE's go here
  * add golang-macros.rb, replacement for the complicated macros in shell in
    macros.go
  * golang-macros.rb:
    + support build with fake build id
    + support build with custom tags (github#7)
    + support pass any -<arg>="a b c" or -<arg>=<value> to go install, shared
      build is possible now (not fully support, other macros need to be adapted)
    + --filelist, to generate filelist used in %files section with excluding
      support
    + use IO.popen to break the build at the exact place
      it fails (github#6)

  * provides the importpath itself
  * fix regex not to check files like .golden in -source
  * filter "test/example" from Provides
  * split common stuff to a module golang/rpmsysinfo.rb
  * rewrite golang.req, now read from stdin RPM feeds, and check __.PKGDEF from
    .a files for "import"s. (github#3 github#4）

== update version 12 ==

  * rewrite golang.prov. it should take filelist feeded by rpm in case not to
    add provides for source/debuginfo/debugsource sub-packages

    Provides candidate.
  * add /usr/bin to golang.attr for go executes to be handled by
    golang-packaging

== update version 4 ==

  * fix encoding error in golang-strip-builddep
  * add macros.go-extra, extra golang macros for packaging
